# UD-Webscraper
This project is a web scraper built using Selenium and Python that logs into the Underdog Fantasy website to extract MLB strikeout projections. The scraper navigates through the website, gathers player names and strikeout values, and saves the extracted data into a CSV file. It sorts the strikeout lines neatly in the CSV.
